## Project Description

Would you rather.. app it's a digital version of the game "would you rather", in which the players have to choose between two options, "this or that". This app was designed with an Avengers Theme, so the users that the game can be played with are heroes from the Marvel Universe of The Avengers, and the questions are mainly about them. Enjoy!
